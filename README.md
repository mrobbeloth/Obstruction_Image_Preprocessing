This was suppose to be an effort to try to separate out the preprocessing, exemplar (database) image building, and matching codes. However it appears that JavaCP is not amendable to use as an ANT based project where I can direct the library to use a custom build and install of OpenCV on my local system containign CUDA and DNN support. I will keep this project around just in case I figure something out. However, I will try a MAVEN based approach from the beginning, it might be easier for such efforts utilizing JavaCP.
